# Main Configuration for Literature Review System

project:
  name: "AI-Powered Literature Review System"
  topic: "Automated systematic literature review using large language models and multi-source APIs"
  output_dir: "./data/output"
  description: "A configurable, production-ready system for automated literature review demonstrating cost-aware LLM selection and multi-tier quality control"

# PAPER 1: Methodology only (no domain-specific case study)
# This describes the AI literature review framework itself

research_domain:
  name: "AI Literature Review Methodologies"
  subject_type: "AI-Assisted Research Methods & Scholarly Communication"
  
  # Metadata keywords describing this research domain
  # (These are NOT direct search queries—they help formulate specific queries)
  keywords:
    - "automated literature review"
    - "large language models for literature synthesis"
    - "systematic review automation"
    - "LLM hallucination in research"
    - "AI-assisted research automation"
  
  description: "Methodologies for automated, rigorous literature review using LLMs with quality control, cost optimization, and human oversight"
  
  # When searching, the system will formulate SPECIFIC queries from these keywords
  # Example query formulation:
  #   From "automated literature review" → 
  #     "automated systematic literature review using AI"
  #     "machine learning literature synthesis workflow"
  #     "LLM-based paper screening and summarization"
  #   From "LLM hallucination in research" →
  #     "preventing hallucination in AI-generated literature reviews"
  #     "fact-checking automated research summaries"
  #     "citation validation in LLM outputs"
  # Each resulting query is narrow and specific
  
  target_journals:
    - "PLOS ONE"
    - "Patterns (Cell Press)"
    - "Scientific Data (Nature)"
    - "Nature Machine Intelligence"

# PAPER 2 (Future): Will be configured separately for irrigation scheduling
# At that time, change research_domain to:
# name: "Irrigation Scheduling in Orchards"
# subject_type: "Precision Agriculture & AI"
# keywords: ["irrigation scheduling AI", "precision agriculture water management", "smart orchard systems", "automated irrigation control"]
# target_journals: [Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, Agricultural Systems, Precision Agriculture]
